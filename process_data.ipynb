Presented with pyuria, fevers, altered mental\\nstatus and leukocytosis to 18.2. Became hypotensive and\\ntachycardic shortly after arrival, which improved with fluid\\nboluses. Initially treated with vancomycin, cefepime and\\nciprofloxacin. Changed to meropenem/ciprofloxacin. Narrowed to\\nciprofloxacin alone once sensitivities available. Fevers, pyuria\\nand leukocytosis resolved within a couple days, and his mental\\nstatus slowly cleared to his baseline.  He was discharged to\\ncomplete 14 day course of ciprofloxacin and he will follow up in\\n[**Hospital 159**] clinic.\\n\\n# Altered mental status\\nAcute delirium in the setting of dementia. Most likely secondary\\nto infectious process. He came in mildly confused and\\npersistently did not know why he was brought to the hospital.\\nHis confusion slowly improved; he became more coherent and\\ninteractive over the course of his stay. He became mildly\\nagitated at times but could be reoriented. No focal neurologic\\nsigns or symptoms.  On discharge he was alert, oriented to\\nperson and place.  He was able to count from 10 to 1 backward.\\nHe was at his baseline on discharge.\\n\\n# EKG changes\\nWhen he became tachycardic to 117 in the setting of sepsis, he\\nhad new ST segment depressions V4-V6. Improved when his heart\\nrate normalized with fluid resuscitation. Negative cardiac\\nenzymes and lack of chest pain or symptoms suggestive of anginal\\nequivalent. EKG changes were likely secondary to demand with\\ntachycardia.\\n\\n# Hypernatremia\\nOn the day prior to discharge, he became mildly hypernatremic\\n(146), likely from poor PO intake and restarting his home dose\\nof 10 mg Lasix. His lasix was held on discharge to be restarted\\nat rehab once back to baseline oral intake.\\n\\n# Urinary retention\\nHe chronically has in indwelling foley catheter for his urinary\\nretention. Likely source of his proteus urosepsis. He had pulled\\nout his prior foley, and a new foley was placed on admission.\\nHe was continued on his home dose of tamulsulosin. He has been\\ndischarged with a foley and he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**]\\nin urology clinic.\\n\\n#Loose Stools - during his admission he had several loose stools\\nper day with small amount of urgency and fecal incontinence.  He\\nwas tested for C. difficile which was negative x2.  On the day\\nof discharge he was placed on a lactose free diet to see if this\\nwould improve his symptoms and his bowel regimen was held.\\n\\n# CHF\\nHe showed no signs or symptoms of acute CHF. His home dose of\\nLasix (10 mg daily) was stopped on admission in the setting of\\nsepsis.  It was held during his hospitalization given decreased\\npo intake.  His intake and weights should be monitored with\\nlasix restarted for weight gain or signs of fluid accumulation.\\n\\n\\n# Atrial fibrillation/flutter\\nIrregularly irregular rhythm, but rate is well-controlled.\\nTreated with 325 mg aspirin daily.
